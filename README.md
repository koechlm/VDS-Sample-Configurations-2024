# VDS-Sample-Configurations--2024

Vault 2024 Data Standard Configuration Samples for Vault Professional/Vault Professional Office.
The sample collection shares 2 configurations with individual scope and compatibility levels:

--- VDS-MFG-Sample --- This configuration sample applies to Vaults based on the default "Manufacturing" behavior configuration. It is also tested in the Vault "PDMC-Sample" environment, which is available for Autodesk Channel Partners. It demonstrates a fully customized approach for all DataSheets, Tabs, and Menu Commands. Additional features like Shortcuts in VDS for CAD or Tools like "Reserve-Numbers" share insights on how to implement extended functionality or additional tools and commands to VDS clients. You can use this sample to learn how to extend a custom configuration with custom Help documentation. The Help content reflects a legacy configuration. I can't afford the time to keep this up to date with the dynamic evolving customization samples; please review the framework rather than the content in detail.

--- VDS-PDMC-Sample --- This extended configuration sample requires a dedicated Vault behavior configuration called "PDMC-Sample"; it is available to Autodesk Channel Partners only. The configuration includes everything of VDS-20xx-Manufacturing-Sample but targets comprehensive VDS feature additions and Vault API consumption.


I created and maintained these configuration samples as an Autodesk employee. However, Autodesk nor I represent that these samples are reliable, accurate, complete, or otherwise valid in other environments. Accordingly, those configuration samples are provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind, and you use the applications at your own risk.

Sincerely,
