# VDS-Sample-Configurations--2024

Vault 2024 Data Standard Configuration Samples for Vault Professional/Vault Professional Office.
The sample collection shares 3 configurations with individual scope and compatibility levels:

--- VDS-MFG-Sample --- This configuration sample applies to Vaults based on the default "Manufacturing" behavior configuration. It is also tested in the Vault "PDMC-Sample" environment available for Autodesk Channel Partners. It demonstrates a full customized approach for all DataSheets, Tabs and Menu Commands. Additional features like Shortcuts in VDS for CAD, or Tools like "Reserve-Numbers" share insights on how to implement extended functionality or additional tools and command to VDS clients. Leverage this sample if you are interested how to extend a custom configuration with a custom Help documentation. The Help content is outdated; please, review the framework rather than the content in detail.

--- VDS-MFG-ERP-Sample --- This sample shares the compatibility level of VDS-MFG-Sample and adds UI and business logic to match the powerGate ERP (www.coolorange.com) connectivity sample for Microsoft Dynamics Navision.

--- VDS-PDMC-Sample --- This extended configuration sample requires a dedicated Vault behavior configuration, called "PDMC-Sample"; it is available to Autodesk Channel Partners only. The configuration includes everything of VDS-20xx-Manufacturing-Sample but targets comprehensive VDS feature additions and Vault API consumption.


I created and maintain this configuration samples as an employee of Autodesk. However, Autodesk nor I represent that these samples are reliable, accurate, complete, or otherwise valid in other environments. Accordingly, those configuration samples are provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind, and you use the applications at your own risk.
